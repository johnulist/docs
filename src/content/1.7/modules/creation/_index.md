# Getting started

## Quick start

Modules must follow some guidelines to work on PrestaShop.

If you want to get started quickly, with a ready-to-use module template, you can use the module
generator available on the [PrestaShop Validator](https://validator.prestashop.com/generator).

It provides an easy way to generate a payment (for PS 1.6 and below) or shipping module, with the basic
structure, the default properties customized and the most common use cases covered (hook, upgrade...).

Other skeletons have been created to help you creating specific modules, as given in the following
references list.

## Tutorial: Understanding your first module

{{% notice note %}}
Before you start writing code for your PrestaShop module, you should be
aware that the PrestaShop team uses a specific set of coding conventions
(or coding standards, coding norm, etc.).

As Wikipedia puts it, "[Coding conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_conventions) are a set of guidelines for a
specific programming language that recommend programming style,
practices and methods for each aspect of a piece program written in this
language", and "Good procedures, good methodology and good coding
standards can be used to drive a project such that the quality is
maximized and the overall development time and development and
maintenance cost is minimized.".

PrestaShop's own standards are available at this page: [Coding standards]({{< ref "/1.7/development/coding-standards" >}}). You should read it in order to make sure that the code you produce fits correctly with the overall code of the PrestaShop project. Configuring your IDE hints or using automated tools like PHPCodeSniffer can help you make sure you follow the standards properly.

Let's create a simple first module; this will enable us to better
describe its structure. We will name it "My module".

First, create the module's folder, in the `/modules` folder. It should
have the same name as the module, with no space, only alphanumerical
characters, the hyphen and the underscore, all in lowercase:
`/mymodule`.

This folder must contain the main file, a PHP file of the same name as
the folder, which will handle most of the processing: `mymodule.php`.

That is enough for a very basic module, but obviously more files and
folders can be added later.

### The constant test

The main mymodule.php file must start with the following test:

```php
<?php
if (!defined('_PS_VERSION_')) {
    exit;
}
```

This checks for the existence of an always-existing PrestaShop constant
(its version number), and if it does not exist, it stops the module from
loading. The sole purpose of this is to prevent malicious visitors to
load this file directly.

Note that, as required by the PrestaShop Coding Standards (see above),
we do not use a PHP closing tag.

### The main class

The main file must contain the module's main class (along with other
classes if needed). PrestaShop uses Object-Oriented programming, and so
do its modules.

That class must bear the same name as the module and its folder, in
CamelCase (see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase>). In our
example: `MyModule`. Furthermore, that class must extend the `Module`
class, in order to inherit all its methods and attributes.

```php
<?php
if (!defined('_PS_VERSION_')) {
    exit;
}

class MyModule extends Module
{
}
```

It can just as well extend any class derived from Module, for specific
needs: `PaymentModule`, `ModuleGridEngine`, `ModuleGraph`, etc.

At this stage, if you place the module's folder on the /modules folder,
the module can already be seen in the "Modules" page in the back office,
in the "Other modules" section – albeit with no real name nor thumbnail.

### The constructor method

Now, let's fill the class' code block with the essential constructor
lines. A constructor is a function in a class that is automatically
called when you create a new instance of a class with new. In the case
of a PrestaShop, the constructor class is the first method to be called
when the module is loaded by PrestaShop. This is therefore the best
place to set most of its details.

```php
<?php
if (!defined('_PS_VERSION_')) {
    exit;
}

class MyModule extends Module
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->name = 'mymodule';
        $this->tab = 'front_office_features';
        $this->version = '1.0.0';
        $this->author = 'Firstname Lastname';
        $this->need_instance = 0;
        $this->ps_versions_compliancy = [
            'min' => '1.6',
            'max' => _PS_VERSION_
        ];
        $this->bootstrap = true;

        parent::__construct();

        $this->displayName = $this->l('My module');
        $this->description = $this->l('Description of my module.');

        $this->confirmUninstall = $this->l('Are you sure you want to uninstall?');

        if (!Configuration::get('MYMODULE_NAME')) {
            $this->warning = $this->l('No name provided');
        }
    }
}
```

Let's examine each line from this first version of the `MyModule`
class...

```php
<?php
// This line defines the class constructor function.
$this->name = 'mymodule';
$this->tab = 'front_office_features';
$this->version = '1.0';
$this->author = 'Firstname Lastname';
```

This section assigns a handful of attributes to the class instance
(`this`):

-   'name' attribute. This attributes serves as an internal identifier.
    The value MUST be the name of the module's folder. Do not use
    special characters or spaces, and keep it lower-case.
-   'tab' attribute. The title for the section that shall contain this
    module in PrestaShop's back office modules list. You may use an
    existing name, such as seo, `front_office_features` or
    `analytics_stats`, or a custom one. In this last case, a new section
    will be created with your identifier. We choose
    "`front_office_features`" because this first module will mostly have
    an impact on the front-end.
-   'version' attribute. The version number for the module, displayed in
    the modules list. You can use as many level of version as you need
    (i.e '1', '1.0', '1.0.3', '0.97.5.2') but keep in mind to follow the 
    [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-specification-semver).
-   'author' attribute. This is displayed as-is in the PrestaShop
    modules list.

Here is the list of available "Tab" attributes, and their corresponding
section in the "Modules" page:

  **"Tab" attribute**           | **Module section**
  ------------------------------|------------------------
  `administration`              | Administration
  `advertising_marketing`       | Advertising & Marketing
  `analytics_stats`             | Analytics & Stats
  `billing_invoicing`           | Billing & Invoices
  `checkout`                    | Checkout
  `content_management`          | Content Management
  `dashboard`                   | Dashboard
  `emailing`                    | E-mailing
  `export`                      | Export
  `front_office_features`       | Front Office Features
  `i18n_localization`           | I18n & Localization
  `market_place`                | Market Place
  `merchandizing`               | Merchandizing
  `migration_tools`             | Migration Tools
  `mobile`                      | Mobile
  `others`                      | Other Modules
  `payments_gateways`           | Payments & Gateways
  `payment_security`            | Payment Security
  `pricing_promotion`           | Pricing & Promotion
  `quick_bulk_update`           | Quick / Bulk update
  `search_filter`               | Search & Filter
  `seo`                         | SEO
  `shipping_logistics`          | Shipping & Logistics
  `slideshows`                  | Slideshows
  `smart_shopping`              | Smart Shopping
  `social_networks`             | Social Networks

Let's continue with the next line in this block of code:

```php
<?php
$this->need_instance = 0;
$this->ps_versions_compliancy = [
    'min' => '1.5',
    'max' => '1.6'
];
$this->bootstrap = true;
```

This section handles the relationship with the module and its
environment (namely, PrestaShop):

-   *need\_instance*. Indicates whether to load the module's class when
    displaying the "Modules" page in the back office. If set at 0, the
    module will not be loaded, and therefore will spend less resources
    to generate the "Modules" page. If your module needs to display a
    warning message in the "Modules" page, then you must set this
    attribute to 1.
-   *ps\_versions\_compliancy*. Indicates which version of PrestaShop
    this module is compatible with. In the example above, we explicitly
    write that this module will only work with PrestaShop 1.5.x, and no
    other major version.
-   *bootstrap*. Indicates that the module's template files have been
    built with PrestaShop 1.6's bootstrap tools in mind – and therefore,
    that PrestaShop should not try to wrap the template code for the
    configuration screen (if there is one) with helper tags.

Next, we call the constructor method from the parent PHP class:

```php
<?php
parent::__construct();
```

This will trigger a lot of actions from PrestaShop that you do not need
to know about at this point. Calling the parent constructor method must
be done after the creation of the `this->name variable` and before any
use of the `this->l()` translation method.

The next section deals with text strings, which are encapsulated in
PrestaShop's translation method, `l()`:

```php
<?php
$this->displayName = $this->l('My module');
$this->description = $this->l('Description of my module.');

$this->confirmUninstall = $this->l('Are you sure you want to uninstall?');

if (!Configuration::get('MYMODULE_NAME')) {
    $this->warning = $this->l('No name provided.');
}
```

These lines respectively assign:

-   A name for the module, which will be displayed in the back office's
    modules list.
-   A description for the module, which will be displayed in the back
    office's modules list.
-   A message, asking the administrator if he really does want to
    uninstall the module. To be used in the installation code.
-   A warning that the module doesn't have its `MYMODULE_NAME` database
    value set yet (this last point being specific to our example, as we
    will see later).

The constructor method is now complete. You are free to add more to it
later if necessary, but this the bare minimum for a working module.

Now go to your back office, then in the Modules page (found at "Modules" > 
"Modules & Services") choose the Selection tab. The module is visible in
the modules list, with its information displayed – and no icon for now.

You can install the module, but it does not do anything yet.

When you click on the "Install" button for your module, it will display
a module window saying that your module is Untrusted.

The only way to make your module Trusted is to distribute it through the
PrestaShop Addons marketplace (with a unique identifying key), or to
become a PrestaShop partner. Other trusted modules are the native ones.

To install the module, click the "Proceed with installation" on this
screen.

Building the install() and uninstall() methods
----------------------------------------------

Some modules have more needs than just using PrestaShop's features in
special ways. Your module might need to perform actions on installation,
such as checking PrestaShop's settings or to registering its own
settings in the database. Likewise, if you changed things in the
database on installation, it is highly recommended to change them back
(or remove them) when uninstalling the module.

The `install()` and `uninstall()` methods make it possible to control
what happens when the store administrator installs or uninstalls the
module. They must be included in the main class' block of code (in our
example, the `MyModule` class) – at the same level as the constructor
method.

### The install() method

Here is the bare minimum for the `install()` method:

```php
<?php
public function install()
{
    return parent::install();
}
```

In this first and extremely simplistic incarnation, this method does the
minimum needed: return true returned by the Module class' `install()`
method, which returns either `true` if the module is correctly
installed, or `false` otherwise. As it is, if we had not created that
method, the superclass' method would have been called instead anyway,
making the end result identical. Nevertheless, we must mention this
method, because it will be very useful once we have to perform checks
and actions during the module's installation process: creating SQL
tables, copying files, creation configuration variables, etc.

So for example how you can expand the `install()` method to perform
installation checks. In the following example, we perform the following
tasks during installation:

-   Check that the Multistore feature is enabled, and if so, set the
    current context to all shops on this installation of PrestaShop.
-   Check that the module parent class is installed.
-   Check that the module can be attached to the `leftColumn` hook.
-   Check that the module can be attached to the `header` hook.
-   Create the `MYMODULE_NAME` configuration setting, setting its value
    to "my friend".


```php
<?php
public function install()
{
    if (Shop::isFeatureActive()) {
        Shop::setContext(Shop::CONTEXT_ALL);
    }

    if (!parent::install() ||
        !$this->registerHook('leftColumn') ||
        !$this->registerHook('header') ||
        !Configuration::updateValue('MYMODULE_NAME', 'my friend')
    ) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```

If any of the lines in the testing block fails, the method returns
`false` and the installation does not happen.

### The uninstall() method

Here is the bare minimum for the uninstall() method:

```php
<?php
public function uninstall()
{
    return parent::uninstall();
}
```

Building on this foundation, we want an uninstall() method that would
delete the data added to the database during the installation (
`MYMODULE_NAME` configuration setting). This method would look like
this:

```php
<?php
public function uninstall()
{
    if (!parent::uninstall() ||
        !Configuration::deleteByName('MYMODULE_NAME')
    ) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```

The Configuration object
------------------------

As you can see, our three blocks of code (`__construct()`, `install()`
and `uninstall()`) all make use of a new object, `Configuration`.

This is a PrestaShop-specific object, built to help developers manage
their module settings. It stores these settings in PrestaShop's database
without require to use SQL queries. Specifically, this object handles
data from the `ps_configuration` database table.

### The main methods

So far, we've used three methods, to which we'll add a fourth one in the
list below:

-   `Configuration::get('myVariable')`: retrieves a specific value from
    the database.
-   `Configuration::getMultiple(array('myFirstVariable', 'mySecondVariable', 'myThirdVariable'))`:
    retrieves several values from the database, and returns a PHP array.
-   `Configuration::updateValue('myVariable', $value)`: updates an
    existing database variable with a new value. If the variable does
    not yet exist, it creates it with that value.
-   `Configuration::deleteByName('myVariable')`: deletes the
    database variable.

There are many more, such as `getInt()` or `hasContext()`, but these
four are the ones you will use the most.

Note that when using `updateValue()`, the content of \$value can be
anything, be it a string, a number, a serialized PHP array or a JSON
object. As long as you properly code the data handling function,
anything goes. For instance, here is how to handle a PHP array using the
`Configuration` object:

```php
<?php
// Storing a serialized array.
Configuration::updateValue('MYMODULE_SETTINGS', serialize(array(true, true, false)));

// Retrieving the array.
$configuration_array = unserialize(Configuration::get('MYMODULE_SETTINGS'));
```

As you can see, this in a very useful and easy-to-use object, and you
will certainly use it in many situations. Most native modules use it too
for their own settings.

### Handling the multistore feature

What is a module compatible with the multistore feature?
It is a module that can be configured differently from one store to another.
Also the same module can have a shared configuration between all shops.
Finally, the module must be able to be activated on one shop and deactivated on another.

By default, all these methods work within the confines of the current
store context, whether PrestaShop is using the multistore feature or
not.

However, it is possible to work outside of the current context and
impact other known stores. This is done using three optional parameters,
which are not presented in the list above:

-   `id_lang`: enables you to force the language with which you want
    to work.
-   `id_shop_group`: enables you to indicate the shop group of the
    target store.
-   `id_shop`: enables you to indicate the id of the target store.

By default, these three parameters use the values of the current
context, but you can use them to target other stores.

Note that it is not recommended to change the default values of these
variables, even more so if the module you are writing is to be used on
other stores than your own. They should only be used if the module is
for your own store, and you know the id and shop group of all of your
shops.

### Retrieving external values from the ps\_configuration data table

You are not limited to your own variables: PrestaShop stores all its own
configuration settings in the ps\_configuration table. There are
literally hundreds of settings, and you can access them just as easily
as you would access your own. For instance:

-   `Configuration::get('PS_LANG_DEFAULT')`: retrieves the ID for the
    default language.
-   `Configuration::get('PS_TIMEZONE')`: retrieves the name of the
    current timezone, in standard TZ format (see:
    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)).
-   `Configuration::get('PS_DISTANCE_UNIT')`: retrieves the default
    distance unit ("km" for kilometers, etc.).
-   `Configuration::get('PS_SHOP_EMAIL')`: retrieves the main contact
    e-mail address.
-   `Configuration::get('PS_NB_DAYS_NEW_PRODUCT')`: retrieves the number
    of days during which a newly-added product is considered "New"
    by PrestaShop.

Dive into the `ps_configuration` table in order to discover many other
settings!

The Shop object
---------------

Another of install()'s lines is this:

```php
<?php
if (Shop::isFeatureActive()) {
    Shop::setContext(Shop::CONTEXT_ALL);
}
```

As said earlier, here we check that the Multistore feature is enabled,
and if so, set the current context to all shops on this installation of
PrestaShop.

The Shop object helps you manage the multistore feature. We will not
dive in the specifics here, but will simply present the two methods that
are used in this sample code:

-   `Shop::isFeatureActive()`: This simply checks whether the multistore
    feature is active or not, and if at least two stores are
    presently activated.
-   `Shop::setContext(Shop::CONTEXT_ALL)`: This changes the context in
    order to apply coming changes to all existing stores instead of only
    the current store.

The Context is explained in more details in the "Using the Context
Object" chapter of this Developer Guide.

The icon file
-------------

To put the finishing touch to this basic module, you should add an icon,
which will be displayed next to the module's name in the back office
modules list. In case your module is made for a prominent service,
having that service's logo visible brings trust. Make sure you do not
use a logo already used by one of the native modules, or without
authorization from the owner of the logo/service.

The icon file must respect these requirements:

-   It must be placed on the module's main folder.
-   32\*32 PNG image.
-   Named `logo.png`.
-   Tip: There are many free 32\*32 icon libraries available. Here are a
    few: <https://www.fatcow.com/free-icons> (very close to the
    FamFamFam one) or
    <http://www.iconarchive.com/show/danish-royalty-free-icons-by-jonas-rask.html>
    (Danish Royalty Free)

Installing the module
---------------------

Now that all basics are in place, reload the back office's "Modules"
pages, in the "Front office features" section, you should find your
module. Install it (or reset it if it is already installed).

During the module's installation, PrestaShop automatically creates a
small `config.xml` file in the module's folder, which stores the
configuration information. You should be very careful when editing by
hand.

## Keeping things secure

Once your module is online, its files could be accessed by anyone from the Internet. Even if they cannot trigger anything but PHP errors, you might want to prevent this from happening.

You can achieve this by adding an `index.php` file at the root of any module folder you create. Here is a suggestion for what to put in the file.

```php
<?php
header('Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT');
header('Last-Modified: ' . gmdate('D, d M Y H:i:s') . ' GMT');
header('Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate');
header('Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0', false);
header('Pragma: no-cache');
header('Location: ../');
exit;
```
